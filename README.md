# 100 Days of Code – Python Journey

This repository contains my progress through the [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/?couponCode=MT250915G4) course on Udemy.

---

## About
This repo tracks my daily coding journey, experiments, and projects while I work through the course.  
It’s very much a work in progress, some sections are rough drafts, some are practice exercises, and others will evolve as I revisit and improve them.

## Roadmap
A rough outline of what’s inside (and what’s coming as I continue learning):

- [**Days 1–10**](./Day01-10) → Python basics, simple scripts, beginner exercises  
- [**Days 11–20**](./Day11-20) → Functions, loops, more structured problems  
- [**Days 21–30**](./Day21-30) → Intermediate projects, working with files and data  
- [**Days 31–50**](./Day31-50) → Object-Oriented Programming, larger projects  
- [**Days 51–70**](./Day51-70) → GUIs, web scraping, APIs  
- [**Days 71–90**](./Day71-90) → Flask, web apps, deployment  
- [**Days 91–100**](./Day91-100) → Capstone projects and final challenges

## Learning Notes
For each project or exercise, I try to add a short reflection including:  
- **What I learned**  
- **Challenges I faced**  
- **Improvements I could make**  

---

## Note
This repository is not intended to be a showcase of polished projects, but rather a record of growth and learning. Over time, the code here will become cleaner, more structured, and more complete.

Thanks for checking out my coding journey! :)
