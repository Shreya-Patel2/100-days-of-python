# 100 Days of Code – Python Journey

This repository contains my progress through the [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/?couponCode=MT250915G4) course on Udemy.

## About
This repo tracks my daily coding journey, experiments, and projects while I work through the course.  
It’s very much a work in progress, some sections are rough drafts, some are practice exercises, and others will evolve as I revisit and improve them.

## Roadmap
A rough outline of what’s inside (and what’s coming as I continue learning):

- [**Days 1–10**](./Day01-10) → Python basics, simple scripts, beginner exercises  
- [**Days 11–20**](./Day11-20) → Functions, loops, more structured problems  
- [**Days 21–30**](./Day21-30) → Intermediate projects, working with files and data  
- [**Days 31–50**](./Day31-50) → Object-Oriented Programming, larger projects  
- [**Days 51–70**](./Day51-70) → GUIs, web scraping, APIs  
- [**Days 71–90**](./Day71-90) → Flask, web apps, deployment  
- [**Days 91–100**](./Day91-100) → Capstone projects and final challenges

## Learning Notes

**What I learned:**  
*(Add a short reflection on key concepts, techniques, or skills you picked up.)*

**Challenges I faced:**  
*(Note any difficulties or obstacles encountered while working on the project.)*

**Improvements I could make:**  
*(Ideas for refactoring, optimising, or better organising the code.)*

## Note
This repository is a record of growth and learning; it currently covers the first 75 days of the course, and is not intended to be a showcase of polished projects. Over time, the remaining days will be added, and the code here will become cleaner, more structured, and more complete.

Thanks for checking out my coding journey! :)
