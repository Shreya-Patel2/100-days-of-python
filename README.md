# 100 Days of Code – My Progress Learning Python

This repository contains my project scripts written while completing [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/?couponCode=MT250915G4) course on Udemy.

## About
I've created this repo to track my improvements over time as I learn Python from the ground up. It’s very much a work in progress, with some projects being complete, and others continually evolving as I revisit and improve them.

---

## Goals
- Build a comprehensive foundation in Python programming, particularly Python for Data Science.
- Learn coding best practice, including how to write efficient and consise code.
- Learn how to debug and solve errors I encounter, allowing me to independently complete projects.

---

## Roadmap
A rough outline of what’s inside (and what’s coming as I continue learning:

- Days 01 – 14 → Data Types, Logical Operators, Lists, Loops, Functions, Dictionaries, Scope, Debugging
- Days 15 – 31 → OOP, GUI, Higher Order Functions, Inheritance, CSVs, List Comprehension, Tkinter, JSON Data  
- Days 32 – 58 → Datetime, APIs, Web Foundation, Selenium, Beautiful Soup, Flask, Bootstrap
- Days 59 – 81 → Databases, SQLAlchemy, Github, Version Control, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, NumPy, Seaborn
- Days 82 – 100 → Professional Projects 



---

## Note
This repository is a record of growth and learning; it currently covers the first ~80 days of the course, and is not intended to be a showcase of polished projects. Over time, the remaining days will be added, and the code here will become cleaner, more structured, and more complete.

Thanks for checking out my coding journey! :)
